```
Average, avg coldest, avg, warmest annual temperatures.
```{r}
mean_annual <- rowMeans(temp_data)
mean_annual

```

(cheating) The summary of the temp_data matrix by month for all sorts of interesting insights arranged by month.
```{r}
summary(temp_data)
```
```{r}
plot(years, mean_annual, main = "Mean temperature",
     ylab = "Mean temp in degrees C")
```

#Facts about temp_data:

1. From the above chart it is clearly visible that in the given period the mean annual temerature is rising.

2. In May the the temperature seems to be the most predictable with mean and median averages lieng within 0.01 degrees, which indicates that May is least likely to record extreme temperatures.
