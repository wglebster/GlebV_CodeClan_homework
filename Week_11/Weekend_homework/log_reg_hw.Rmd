  ggpairs(cardinality_threshold = 52, report = FALSE)

juice %>%
ggplot(aes(x = weekof_purchase, y = purchase_mm)) +
  geom_col()
#there seems to be quite a lot of variability in purchase_mm depending on weekof_purchase, therefore I will keep weekof_purchase variable.

juice %>%
  select(pairs1) %>%
  ggpairs(cardinality_threshold = 52, report = FALSE)
#weekof_purchase, store_id

juice %>%
  select(pairs2) %>%
  ggpairs(report = FALSE)
#price_mm, disc_mm

juice %>%
  select(pairs3)%>%
  ggpairs(report = FALSE)
#special_ch, special_mm, ?loyal_ch

I think, if I was building a model manually, I would use the following variables: weekof_purchase, store_id, price_mm, disc_mm, special_ch, special_mm, sale_price_ch, pct_disc_mm, loyal_ch.

But I am finding it hard to understand, so I will make an automated feature selection.

```{r}
#create training & testing datasets
n_data <- nrow(juice)
test_index <- sample(1:n_data, size = n_data*0.1)

test_juice <- slice(juice, test_index)
train_juice <- slice(juice, -test_index)
```

```{r}
library(modelr)
library(pROC)
```


```{r}
#as baseline I will build a model that includes all features
all_feature_model <- glm(purchase_mm~., data = train_juice, 
                         family = binomial(link = "logit"))

all_feature_pred <- train_juice %>%
  add_predictions(all_feature_model, type = "response")


roc_all_feature_model <- all_feature_pred %>%
  roc(response = purchase_mm, predictor = pred)

roc_curve_all_feature <- ggroc(data = roc_all_feature_model, legacy.axes = TRUE)
coord_fixed()

roc_curve_all_feature

```


```{r}
#secondly I will attempt to plot my selected features
manual_feature_check <- glm(purchase_mm ~ weekof_purchase + store_id + price_mm + disc_mm + special_ch + special_mm + sale_price_ch + pct_disc_mm + loyal_ch, data = train_juice, family = binomial(link = "logit"))

manual_feature_pred <- train_juice %>%
  add_predictions(all_feature_model, type = "response")

roc_manual_feature_model <- manual_feature_pred %>%
  roc(response = purchase_mm, predictor = pred)

roc_curve_manual_feature <- ggroc(data = roc_manual_feature_model, legacy.axes = TRUE)
coord_fixed()

roc_curve_all_feature
```

Curves of both models look almost identical :)

Automated model no interactions

```{r}
library(glmulti)
```

```{r}
auto_all_feature_model <- glmulti(purchase_mm ~ . , #testing effects of all features
                                  data = train_juice, #using training dataset
                                  level = 1, # main effects only, no interactions
                                  method = "h", #exhaustive search
                                  crit = "bic", 
                                  confsetsize = 10, #keeping only best 10 models
                                  plotty = FALSE, #no plotting during iteration
                                  report = TRUE, #report progress during iteration
                                  fitfunction = "glm",
                                  family = binomial(link = "logit")
                                  )

summary(auto_all_feature_model)
```
Best model has been identified as: purchase_mm ~ loyal_ch + price_diff

```{r}
auto_all_feature_model_w_int <- glmulti(purchase_mm ~ . , #testing effects of all features
                                  data = train_juice, #using training dataset
                                  level = 2, # include interactions
                                  marginality = TRUE, #consider pairs only if features are in the model
                                  method = "h", #exhaustive search
                                  crit = "bic", 
                                  confsetsize = 10, #keeping only best 10 models

                                  fitfunction = "glm",
                                  family = binomial(link = "logit")
